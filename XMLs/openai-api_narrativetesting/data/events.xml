		<Conclusion>
	In the myth of Apollo's Pursuit of Daphne, Apollo's relentless pursuit of her could potentially be driven by a layer of jealousy or possessiveness since he and Eros were lovers. As Eros may have intentionally caused this unrequited love, Apollo's struggle to win Daphne's affection would have been more complicated. He may have tried to convince himself and others that he was only interested in her, when in reality, he was also dealing with conflicting feelings towards Eros. On the other hand, if Eros was sympathetic to Apollo's plight, he may have tried to help Apollo win Daphne's affections despite his own feelings for Apollo. The story of Daphne ultimately serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked desire and the importance of respecting others' autonomy and boundaries.

		<Conclusion>
		The fact that Eros is often depicted as a beautiful, winged god, while Apollo is the god of prophecies and visions, adds an interesting layer of conflict and irony to the story of Psyche falling in love with an "ugly" monster. As Eros forbids Psyche from looking at him. It also underscores the idea that beauty is not just skin deep, and that true love transcends appearances. The fact that Apollo is the god of prophecies may suggest that he foresaw the outcome of Psyche's love affair with Eros, adding to his bitterness and jealousy. Apollo, being the god of prophecies, had saw the outcome of their love affair and felt powerless to stop it. This made Apollo's feelings of betrayal and hurt even more intense, and lead to him acting out in ways that he wouldn't normally. The outcome between Psyche and Eros-- was an understand of what eventually evolved into a familial love rather than a romantic one.
