# GDDs
These are game design documents; and high pitch documents that I have created in my endeavours of thinking of projects and exploring ideas. 
Some, such as Sidewinder and Necrohack were fully designed with the intention to create a prototype, and then start creating scalable iterations based on feedback for a paid project.

All the ideas are mine alone; however, the template for them is free to use with appropriate credit.

## Table of Contents

* __AndersonDatorien_RVN_Category1__ - A High Pitch concept created for the Raven Software Jr. Campaign Designer position.
* __Cipher Protocol Design Document__ - Early Concept document of a contained, zero-sum game. Still in progress. Project Cipher was designed as a horror mystery with the idea of giving clues to the player via a cmd type window. This idea would have used a WorldResourceManager script to keep track of all resources and make sure non spawn back within' certain limits.
* __OmegaColony_FinalGDD__ - Fully finished game design document of a Space based card game created for a course project in 2018. Playtests included.
* __Project SIDEWINDER__ - Creative/Game Design Document of a game I proprosed in Feburary 2021; a card-based, narrative game with a time limit. Was to be helped with by another programmer and discord group called Electro Wizardry. After Omega Rex, was done -- helped with Production of Omega Rex. https://electrowizardry.itch.io/omegarex (However, main programmer disappeared thus project is in limbo.) 
          - Simulation of Agent Cards / Mock ups here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C8pUIWSC4505ULU8LwpIXpGqj4vZ6ZZLhLfD6h3lczQ/edit?usp=sharing
* __Project Necrohack__ - High Pitch/Creative Doc of a horror/puzzle game about hacking the dead to gain their knowledge to solve a mystery.
* __Project Trainpusher__ - High Pitch/Creative Doc about a game-based on surviving purely on a train in a zombie-apocalypse type world.
* __Project Deignis__ - Game Design Document about a horror/cult sim-type game where the player manages a BnB, Cult and must end another cult. Three endings proposed; this would be a narrative-based one with a type of game timer and warning system. 
* __Solomon's Gambit__ - High Pitch concept with Payout matrices for a slot machine; which includes a pity system game type. Payout is based on official rules.
* __Project Schism__ - A game jam game *(created in a month)* where the prompt is playing both sides; the player must balance light and dark to get through. Playtests included.
* __Project Kowloon__ - A Battle-Royale type game pitch where all players must ascended contained inside of a Kowloon-style walled city building and must ascend to the top; minimal guns, only using melee. There would have been a gas pushing upwards to keep players progressing.
* __Project Brimstone__ - A game pitch in video where it's a gameshow based game. The only true direct competitors would have been Fall Guys & Dead Rising: Terror Is Reality. The player goes through seven-layers of hell in game stages and the audience interaction is by spectators *(via Mixer (at the time) or Twitch)*. Each level was one level of hell and the mechanics would match the layer. The player is a lost soul, a contestant in Hell. Dark humor.
