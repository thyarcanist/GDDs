# GDDs
These are game design documents; and high pitch documents that I have created in my endeavours of thinking of projects and exploring ideas. 
Some, such as Sidewinder and Necrohack were fully designed with the intention to create a prototype, and then start creating scalable iterations based on feedback for a paid project.

All the ideas are mine alone; however, the template for them is free to use with appropriate credit.

[TableOfContents]

AndersonDatorien_RVN_Category1 - A High Pitch concept created for the Raven Software Jr. Campaign Designer position.
Cipher Protocol Design Document - Early Concept document of a contained, zero-sum game. Still in progress. Project Cipher was designed as a horror mystery with the idea of giving clues to the player via a cmd type window. This idea would have used a WorldResourceManager script to keep track of all resources and make sure non spawn back within' certain limits.
OmegaColony_FinalGDD - Fully finished game design document of a Space based card game created for a course project in 2018. Playtests included.
Project SIDEWINDER - Creative/Game Design Document of a game proprosed in Feburary 2021; a rts, narrative-based game with a time limit. Was to be helped with by another programmer and discord group called Electro Wizardry. After Omega Rex, was done -- helped with Production of Omega Rex. https://electrowizardry.itch.io/omegarex (However, main programmer disappeared and removed a lot.)
Project Necrohack - High Pitch/Creative Doc of a horror/puzzle game about hacking the dead to gain their knowledge to solve a mystery.
Project Trainpusher - High Pitch/Creative Doc about a game-based on surviving purely on a train in a zombie-apocalypse type world.
Project Deignis - Game Design Document about a horror/cult sim-type game where the player manages a BnB, Cult and must end another cult. Three endings proposed; this would be a narrative-based one with a type of game timer and warning system. 
Solomon's Gambit - High Pitch concept with Payout matrices for a slot machine; which includes a pity system game type. Payout is based on official rules.
Project Schism - A game jam game (created in a month) where the prompt is playing both sides; the player must balance light and dark to get through. Playtests included.
Project Kowloon - A Battle-Royale type game pitch where all players must ascended contained inside of a building and must ascend to the top; minimal guns, only using melee.
Project Brimstone - A game pitch in video where it's a gameshow based game. The only true direct competitors would have been Fall Guys & Dead Rising: Terror Is Reality. The player goes through seven-layers of hell in game stages and the audience interaction is by spectators (via Mixer (at the time) or Twitch). Each level was one level of hell and the mechanics would match the layer. The player is a lost soul, a contestant in Hell. Dark humor.
